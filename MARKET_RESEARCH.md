# Mentalwell International Expansion — VC Market Research
**Prepared: February 2026 | For Investor Deck Review**

---

## Executive Summary

Mentalwell's current expansion plan (Ireland 2028, US/Canada 2029) is sound but suboptimal. Research identifies significantly larger market opportunities than currently stated in the deck, a strong post-Cerebral/Done entry narrative for the US, and several underserved EU markets that should be entered before North America.

**Recommended revised timeline:** Ireland (2027) → Netherlands + Germany (2028) → US (2029) → Canada + Nordics (2030)

## US MARKET

### Market Size — Larger Than Your Deck States

| Current Deck | Recommended Update | Why |
|---|---|---|
| US TAM: 14M | **30M** (ADHD + ASD combined) | Current figure is ADHD-only; ASD adds ~12.5M |
| US SAM: 11.9M | **16M** (undiagnosed) | ~9.2M undiagnosed ADHD adults + ~4M undiagnosed ASD adults |
| Combined £20B+ | **$30B+** (assessment + treatment) | US alone exceeds your current combined figure |

### Prevalence Data

**ADHD (US):**
- Children: 6.0M diagnosed (~9.8% prevalence, CDC 2022)
- Adults: 11.5M estimated (4.4% prevalence, NIMH), only 20% diagnosed
- **9.2M undiagnosed US adults** — massive addressable market
- Adult diagnosis growing ~25% YoY since 2020

**ASD (US):**
- Children: 1 in 36 (CDC ADDM 2023, up from 1 in 44)
- Adults: ~5.4M on the spectrum, only 20-25% diagnosed
- **~4M undiagnosed autistic adults** in the US

### Competitive Landscape — The Post-Cerebral Gap

The US ADHD telehealth market was dominated by two players that both imploded:

**Cerebral** (raised $300M+ at $4.8B valuation):
- DOJ investigation → settled for ~$10M
- Stopped prescribing stimulants
- Dramatically reduced operations

**Done** (raised ~$80M):
- Co-founder indicted for healthcare fraud
- Alleged facilitation of 40M+ Adderall pills
- Effectively ceased operations

**This created:**
1. A **trust deficit** — VCs and patients want clinically rigorous providers
2. **Millions of patients without a provider**
3. No one owns "gold standard telehealth ADHD assessment"
4. Investor appetite shifted to compliance-first models
5. Insurance companies pulled back from quick-diagnosis providers

**Gap for Mentalwell:** Clinically rigorous, AI-augmented assessment with NHS credibility. The US is starving for a provider that investors, insurers, and regulators can trust.

### Key US Competitors (Active)

| Company | Rigor | Prescribing | Price | Insurance | States |
|---------|-------|-------------|-------|-----------|--------|
| Talkiatry | High | Yes, stimulants | $250-500/visit | In-network | 40+ |
| Ahead/ADHD Online | Medium | Limited | $199-399 | No | ~30 |
| Klarity | Low-Med | Yes | $149/visit | Some | ~25 |
| Circle Medical | Medium | Yes | $100-250 | In-network | ~15 |
| **Mentalwell** | **Very High** | **Assessment-first** | **$995-1,495** | **Target in-network** | **5-10 entry** |

### ASD — Massively Underserved in the US

- Wait times: **12-18 months** (some regions 2-3 years)
- Out-of-pocket cost: **$3,000-$7,000**
- Almost no telehealth players offer comprehensive ASD evaluation
- ADHD and ASD co-occur in **30-50% of cases** — combined offering is unique
- Research validates remote ASD evaluation at 80-90% concordance with in-person

### Pricing Strategy for US Entry

| Service | Self-Pay | Insurance Target |
|---------|----------|-----------------|
| ADHD Assessment | $995-$1,495 | $800-$1,500 |
| ASD Assessment | $1,800-$2,500 | $1,500-$2,000 |
| Follow-up Management | $150-$250/visit | $100-$200/visit |

### Regulatory Requirements

**State Licensing:**
- Medicine licensed at state level (not federal)
- IMLC (Interstate Medical Licensure Compact): 42 states — expedited multi-state licensing in 3-6 weeks
- PSYPACT (Psychology Compact): 41 states — for ASD assessment psychologists

**Corporate Structure:**
- Must establish US legal entity (Delaware C-Corp)
- MSO (Management Services Organization) structure needed in 30+ states due to Corporate Practice of Medicine laws
- Malpractice insurance: $10,000-$50,000/year per clinician

**DEA/Prescribing:**
- Assessment-only avoids DEA complexity entirely
- Telehealth prescribing rules still evolving (extended through at least end of 2025)
- Recommendation: Enter with assessment-only, add prescribing as rules stabilize

**FDA/AI:**
- If AI is positioned as Clinical Decision Support (assists clinicians) rather than autonomous diagnosis → may avoid FDA clearance requirement
- If autonomous: Class II medical device, 510(k) clearance, 18-36 months, $500K-$2M
- **Recommendation:** Position as clinician support tool

**HIPAA:**
- Required for all patient data
- UK GDPR compliance is actually more stringent in many areas — head start

### Recommended US Entry Strategy

| Phase | Year | Action |
|-------|------|--------|
| Preparation | 2028 | US legal entity, MSO structure, begin clinician credentialing via IMLC, insurance panel applications |
| Entry | 2029 | Assessment-only (ADHD + ASD), self-pay, 5 states: FL, TX, CO, GA, NC |
| Scale | 2030 | Add insurance, expand to 15-20 states, partner with local prescribers |
| Full | 2031 | 40+ states, prescribing services, B2B employer contracts |

## EU MARKETS — Ranked by Entry Priority

### #1: Ireland (Score: 9.5/10) — Recommended 2027

**Why it's the best first market:**
- English-speaking — zero localization cost
- UK clinician qualifications (MRCPsych) recognized via Common Travel Area
- GMC → Medical Council of Ireland registration: **4-8 weeks**
- No CQC equivalent for outpatient clinics — lower regulatory burden than UK
- GDPR-compliant (Mentalwell already is)

**The demand:**
- Adult ADHD essentially unavailable in public system (HSE)
- Public ADHD wait times: **2-4 years** (children), adults barely assessed at all
- ASD wait times: **18-36 months**
- Private ADHD assessment: EUR 400-800
- Private ASD assessment: EUR 1,500-2,500
- Population: 5.1M, addressable ADHD market: **EUR 35-70M**

**Competition:** Fragmented private psychiatrists, no dominant AI-powered platform. Significant first-mover opportunity.

**Setup cost:** EUR 50,000-100,000
**Year 1 target:** 500-1,000 patients, EUR 500K-1M revenue

---

### #2: Netherlands (Score: 8.0/10) — Recommended 2028

**Why it's strong:**
- **80,000+ people** on mental health wait lists (political crisis)
- Highest English proficiency in EU — expat beachhead strategy viable
- Amsterdam alone: ~200,000 international residents
- Progressive telehealth regulation, digitally advanced
- Insurance covers ADHD/ASD assessment (EUR 1,000-3,000 per trajectory)

**The demand:**
- ADHD wait: **6-12 months** for specialist assessment
- GGZ intake wait: **14-20 weeks** (some regions 30+)
- Growing 15-20% annually in private mental health

**Barriers:** WTZi institutional license for insurance billing, need Dutch-registered clinicians for full market

**Strategy:** Launch English-language service for expats first, simultaneously pursue Dutch-language expansion

**Setup cost:** EUR 150,000-250,000

---

### #3: Germany (Score: 7.0/10) — Recommended 2028-2029

**Why it matters:**
- Largest EU economy (84M population)
- ~2.9M adults with ADHD, severely underdiagnosed
- Private insurance (PKV, 13% of population) accessible without KV accreditation
- DiGA pathway exists for digital health apps
- Addressable market: **EUR 500M-1B**

**Barriers:** Language (German-only assessments), KV accreditation for statutory insurance (1-2 years), must hire German-registered clinicians

**Strategy:** Enter via PKV (private insurance) market in Berlin, Munich, Hamburg — no KV needed

**Setup cost:** EUR 250,000-400,000

---

### #4: Sweden (Score: 6.5/10) — Recommended 2029

- High ADHD awareness, telehealth leader
- Wait times: 6-18 months
- But limited private market (comprehensive public system)
- Could serve as Nordic hub (Denmark linguistically similar)
- Best as partnership/acquisition play

---

### #5: Spain (Score: 6.0/10) — Recommended 2029-2030

- 47.4M population, growing ADHD awareness
- Addressable market: EUR 300-600M
- But requires full Spanish localization
- Best entered through local partnership model

---

### Lower Priority (Phase 4, 2030+)

- **France** (5.5/10): Massive latent demand (lowest diagnosis rates in Western Europe), but language barrier + complex reimbursement + historical ADHD skepticism
- **Italy** (5.0/10): 59M population, massive underdiagnosis, but low digital health adoption + complex regional regulation
- **Denmark/Norway** (5.5/10): Small markets, comprehensive public systems limit private opportunity

---

## EU-WIDE REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS

### EU AI Act (August 2026)
- AI for medical diagnosis = **high-risk** classification
- Requirements: risk management, data governance, technical documentation, human oversight, CE marking
- Conformity assessment cost: **EUR 100,000-300,000**
- **Mentalwell advantage:** Already has clinician oversight (human-in-the-loop)
- **Key strategy:** Position AI as clinical workflow tool, not autonomous diagnostic

### EU Medical Device Regulation (MDR)
- AI diagnostic tools = medical device (Class IIa or IIb)
- CE marking: **12-18 months, EUR 200,000-500,000**
- If AI framed as workflow/efficiency tool → may avoid MDR classification entirely
- Regulatory positioning is critical

### Post-Brexit Qualifications
- UK qualifications no longer auto-recognised across EU (except Ireland via CTA)
- Each country requires individual recognition (2-6 months)
- **Practical approach:** Hire locally licensed clinicians; AI platform + operational playbook are the scalable assets

### GDPR
- Mentalwell already compliant — advantage
- Additional needs: local DPO, DPIA for AI processing, cross-border transfer mechanisms
- UK adequacy decision currently valid but reviewed periodically
